- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned to leverage styled components in React for dynamic styling based on screen width, enabling responsive design. Additionally, I gained proficiency in utilizing TypeScript to add type safety and enhance the development experience, ensuring robust code. This combination empowered me to create more adaptable and maintainable web applications.

below is some code i'm proud of,

```css
@media (min-width: 781px) and (max-width: 850px) {
  li:nth-last-child(2) {
    color: black;
  }
  li:last-child {
    color: black;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 851px) and (max-width: 1030px) {
  li:last-child {
    color: black;
  }
}
```

the above code allows me to change the color of the navigation list items based on the size of the screen.

### Continued development

I aspire to enhance my proficiency in utilizing CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components to create visually appealing and responsive user interfaces. also, I plan to explore backend technologies such as Ruby and databases like PostgreSql to broaden my skill set and develop full-stack applications.
